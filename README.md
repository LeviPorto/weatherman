# Weatherman

## How to up

* First, you need setup Java 8 Environment (JDK, JRE... )
* After, open this project in any IDE (i recommend Intellij)
* Before running this API on IDE, you need to run eureka-preoday and config-preoday (Observation: without this service, weatherman donÂ´t will up, it will complain about missing properties)
* Ensure that you have Lombok plugin on IDE, as well configuration to put Lombok Annotation Processor
* Now, you can run without problems :)
